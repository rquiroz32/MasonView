an exercise in which I was tasked to create a random pwd generator

This was an excercise where we were given some framework html and css with an event listener on the generate button. We had to supply the rest of the javascript to build out a random (or nearly random) password generator. The purpose of this excercise was really to further cement the use of loops and conditional checks.
